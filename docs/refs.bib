  abstract    = {Printed circuits in bounded media encompass a wide range  of practical structures such as discontinuities in  waveguides, planar circuits embedded in shielded  multilayered media or even two-dimensional printed periodic  structures. The Electromagnetic (EM) modeling of printed  circuits in layered bounded media is performed via an  Integral Equation (IE) technique. Green's functions (GFs)  are specially defined to satisfy both the Boundary  Conditions (BCs) imposed by the layered media and by the  transverse boundary enclosing the entire structure.  Finally, a system of IEs on the equivalent sources can be  solved numerically by means of the Method of Moments (MoM).  Each of the problems enumerated above has already been  solved by other authors using IE-MoM techniques.  Nevertheless, our formulation introduces a unified approach  applicable to all the aforementioned problems. Due to the  symmetry presented by a bounded layered media, the GF  problem can be reduced into a two-dimensional transverse  boundary problem and a one-dimensional transmission line  problem in the normal direction. Both problems can be  treated independently. This thesis proposes and fully  develops an efficient technique that encompasses different  laterally bounded multilayered problems with a seamless  transition between them. The method is based on a modal  representation of the transverse boundary problem and on  the expansion of the equivalent surface currents by  zero-curl &amp; constant-charge Basis Functions (BFs). It  offers a unified and versatile approach that, on one hand  eliminates redundancy in the formulation and on the other  hand simplifies each particular problem to the evaluation  of constant coefficients or basic line integrals.  Analytical solutions can be found for the combination of  linear subsectional basis functions in rectangular and  circular Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) boundaries as  well as for periodic lattices. This thesis then solves the  problem of transmission line model in the longitudinal  direction by proposing an efficient algorithm that  guarantees numerical stability under a variety of known  critical conditions where other already known formulations  fail. In addition, it introduces alternate equivalent  expressions of this formulation that allow new  interpretations of the problem. Due to its practical  interest, the method is applied for the EM modeling of  multilayered boxed printed circuits. This motivated the  implementation of a dedicated software tool for the  efficient analysis of these topologies including losses.  Extensive numerical experiments have been carried out to  assess the validity of the aforementioned theory and some  properties of test-structures (losses, mesh, etc).},

The proposed scheme maintains the error controllable nature of the so-called partition-extrapolation methods, often used to tackle this problem, whereas it requires substantially reduced computational time. Moreover, the proposed method is very easy to implement, since the associated weights and abscissas can be precomputed. The overall behavior of the proposed method both in terms of accuracy and efficiency is demonstrated through a series of representative numerical experiments, where compared with one of the most proven methods available in the literature.},

  abstract    = {To meet strict requirements of the information society  technologies, antennas and circuit elements are becoming  increasingly complex. Frequently, their electromagnetic  (EM) properties cannot be anymore expressed in closed-form  analytical expressions mainly because of the multitude of  irregular geometries found in actual devices. Therefore,  accurate and efficient (in terms of computational time and  memory) electromagnetic models coupled with the robust  optimization techniques, are needed in order to be able to  predict and optimize the behavior of the innovative  antennas in complex environments. The contribution of this  thesis consists in the development and improvement of  accurate electromagnetic modeling and optimization  algorithms for an ubiquitous class of antennas, the planar  printed antennas. The approach most commonly used to model  and analyze this type of structures is the Integral  Equation (IE) technique numerically solved using the Method  of Moments (MoM). From the computational point of view, the  main challenge is to develop techniques for efficient  numerical evaluation of spatial-domain Green's functions,  which are commonly expressed in terms of the well-known  Sommerfeld integrals (SIs), i.e., semi-infinite range  integrals with Bessel function kernels. Generally, the  analytical solution of the SIs is not available, and their  numerical evaluation is notoriously difficult and  time-consuming because the integrands are both oscillatory  and slowly decaying, and might possess singularities on  and/or near the integration path. Due to the key role that  SIs play in many EM problems, the development of fast and  accurate techniques for their evaluation is of paramount  relevance. This problem is studied in detail and several  efficient methods are developed. Finally, the applicability  of one of these methods, namely the Weighted Averages (WA)  technique, is extended to the challenging case appearing in  many practical EM problems: the evaluation of semi-infinite  integrals involving products of Bessel functions. However,  the development of effective analysis codes is only one  aspect. At least equally important is the availability of  reliable optimization techniques for an adequate design of  antennas. For that purpose, the Particle Swarm Optimization  (PSO) algorithm is introduced in the context of our  analysis codes. Moreover, the innovative hybrid version of  the PSO algorithm, called the Tournament Selection PSO, has  been proposed with the aim of even further improving  convergence performances of the classical PSO algorithm.  Detailed theoretical description of this socially inspired  evolutionary algorithm is given in the thesis. Finally, the  characteristics of both algorithms are compared throughout  several EM optimization problems.},

  abstract    = {Abstract Printed multilayered media with metallizations  embedded between dielectric layers are one of the most  successful technologies for manufacturing planar structures  with a good performanceto-price ratio. These structures  range from PC board circuits, through cavity backed  antennas and antenna arrays used in satellite  communications, to waveguide filters. The approach most  commonly used to model and analyze the aforementioned  structures is the Integral Equation (IE) technique solved  with Method of Moments (MoM). Applying IE-MoM with  subsectional basis functions to electromagnetically large  structures is demanding in terms of both computer memory  allocation and time needed to solve the problem.  Computationally efficient techniques are thus needed to  accelerate the IE-MoM procedures and allow modeling of  large circuits and antennas on standard desktop PCs.  Subdomain Multilevel Approach (SMA) with Macro-Basis  Functions (MBF) is one of the acceleration techniques,  developed in our laboratory. Its application to modeling  large antenna arrays has already proven to be very  efficient. However, this technique can be improved,  especially when MoM matrix filling time is concerned. This  thesis proposes an improvement of the SMA using equivalent  moments in computing the interactions between macro-basis  functions. It shows that, without significant loss of  accuracy, we obtain a two-fold gain in computational time  for structures with the number of unknowns of the order  104. In structures operating at higher frequencies (thin  films in millimeter and submillimeter wave bands) or with  self supporting metallic plates, the thickness of metallic  screens must be taken into account. Multilayered structures  with apertures (holes) in thick conducting screens can be  accurately modeled using the equivalence theorem and  magnetic currents introduced at both aperture interfaces.  This approach, however, doubles the number of unknowns as  compared to that one of the zero-thickness case. Moreover,  the thick aperture problem asks for the computation of  cavity Green's functions, which is a difficult and  time-consuming task for apertures of arbitrary  cross-sections. This thesis addresses the problem of  scattering by apertures in thick conducting screens by  introducing an approximate and computationally efficient  formulation. This formulation consists in treating the  thick aperture as an infinitely thin one and in using the  correction term in integral equation kernel that accounts  for the screen thickness. The number of unknowns remains  the same as in the zero-thickness screens and evaluation of  complicated cavity Green's functions is obviated, which  yields computationally efficient routines. The technique is  successfully applied to self-supporting aperture antennas  and thick irises within multilayered rectangular waveguides  giving good results for apertures whose thickness is  smaller than their lateral dimensions.},
