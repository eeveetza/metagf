abstract = "A review is presented of the most effective methods for the computation of Sommerfeld integral tails. Such integrals, which are often oscillatory, singular and divergent, commonly arise in layered media Green functions. The mathematical foundations of various pertinent methods are discussed
in detail and their performance is illustrated by relevant numerical examples. The associated algorithms are given in pseudocode for their easy computer implementation.",
